    <h2>Creating and nesting components</h2>
    <p>React apps are made out of components. A component is a piece of the UI (user interface) that has its own logic and appearance. A component can be as small as a button, or as large as an entire page.</p>
    <p>React components are JavaScript functions that return markup</p>
    <div>
        function MyButton() { <br>
  return (
    &lt;button&gt; I'm a button&lt;button&gt;
  );
}
    </div>
</body>
